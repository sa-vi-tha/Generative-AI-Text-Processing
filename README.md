🚀 Built a Generative AI Text Processing App using Hugging Face Transformers & Gradio! 🔥

Excited to share my latest project where I developed an interactive AI-powered text processing tool using Gradio and Transformers. This app enables users to:

✅ Summarize Text 📖 – Using the Facebook BART model, it condenses lengthy content while retaining key insights.

✅ Translate Text (EN → FR) 🌍 – Leveraging the Helsinki-OPUS-MT model, it translates English text to French seamlessly.

✅ Generate Text ✍️ – With GPT-2, it creates coherent and contextually relevant text from user prompts.

✅ Classify Emotions 😊😢😡 – Using a DistilBERT-based model, it detects the underlying emotion in a given text.

💡 Tech Stack Used:
✔ Python 🐍
✔ Hugging Face Transformers 🤗
✔ Gradio for UI ⚡
✔ Pre-trained NLP models

This project deepened my understanding of NLP, model fine-tuning, and building AI-powered applications with an intuitive UI. 🚀
